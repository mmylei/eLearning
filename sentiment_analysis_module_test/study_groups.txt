I did the chocolate meal too. I found that I didn't get bored of the taste that much. I feel like 3 minutes is a little too long to wait because every after 3 mins I try another piece, it just always brings creamy and sweet flavor back and makes me feel good again. maybe I should try with dark chocolate instead. The one I tried was milk chocolate.
Neutral
Study Groups
Hi! I tried the pure chocolate too. I'm not a fan but I would say it changes my perspectives hahaha, I did it with 'dark bites' and was cool. And I'd love the other assignment, how taking them by turns change your perception on flavor even if it's not supposed to taste like that, for me I could say I like to cook, so often I do something similar with salt on chocolate mousse and changes so much, is a funny taste.

Hi! I did the pure chocolate menu, I'm not really taken by chocolate, but something change my mind after this, like the third one maybe because of the anticipation was even better than first one, the rest is another story. Good excersise!

That's an interesting test with mangoes, Larry. What was the outcome? I  spent this summer gorging on mangoes (we have a mango tree in the  garden) but could not go beyond one raw mango without my teeth feeling  like they will fall off.
Neutral
Study Groups
In week three lecture 2 - It is good to see red! - When Professor. King Chow talks about the Opponent Colour Theory and then he shows you what he is talking about with the 'mango on the blue background' and the 'chili on the green background'. What would happen if you had, say, something yellow on a green background? Would the colours be switched around after he switched screens and you blinked like they did with the opponent colours? Or after you blinked would they stay the same colours? OR after you blinked would they not really be any colour? Any thoughts?

Hi, I'm Filipino but migrated to Australia when I was little. I totally agree about the lack of awareness about Filipino cuisine, although there are a sprinkling of restaurants around, as well as home catering. An Australian show called also featured Filipino food, which I thought was pretty exciting! Food's the biggest connection I have to the Philippines, especially during Christmas time when the extended family gets together and has the most awesome feasts! My sisters and I are putting together a cookbook of my lola's dishes (very loose recipes that are more of a guide, since she believes in experimenting more than following instructions...). What are some of your favourite Filipino dishes?

Hi Sienna! I'm Filipina too :) My favorite Filipino dishes are... too many to mention. Haha. But I have to say adobo tops the list.

Hi, friends! Dani here. I'm so happy there are so many Filipinos and Filipinas as well as people interested in Filipino cuisine! Things are generally sweeter in our country.

Neutral

Thanks! But in case there is no budget constraint and purely were just basing it to your own preference po? which one will you buy?
Neutral
Study Groups
Hi Abbie! I would buy toblerone because of what is written on the packaging as well as the taste. Although I prefer to buy dark chocolates because it contains less sugar and is much healthier. Ingredients: Sugar, whole milk powder, , honey (3%), milk fat, almonds (1.6%), emulsifier (soya lecithin), egg white, flavouring (vanillin). Toblerone is made with compared to the taht was used to make Flat tops. The ingredients of the chocolates as well as how it is marketed also determines the price. A should have 5 main ingredients: (Example: Toblerone) A is made up of the following (Example: Flat Tops)
Neutral

hi abbie, without budget constraint, I think the appearance counts most and then the brand. In culinary, there is a saying that 'we eat with our eyes'. Meaning, the first sense that is stimulated are the eyes that is why there is the color additives on food.

Alright guys, if you're up for it, I can arrange a place for about 50 people in the center of Amsterdam (without kitchen, though). Something like 19-21h or 20-22h would be possible, and I propose e.g. Thursday, July 18.

I am definitively up to it and the date is OK. What's your idea about the meeting? Just an informal gathering or should we have a purpose and / or some kind of agenda? Do you want people to bring food / drinks or is it more a meeting kind of gathering? Happy to help you organise if you want.
Neutral
Study Groups
Well, the idea came to me yesterday, so I thought we could define it here together. Given that there's no kitchen in the place I can arrange, I suppose it would be less hands-on, but we can discuss the concepts covered in the course. You can think of it as a networking event, too. If there is interest, we can set up an agenda, where people can present themselves or their initiatives. Let's gather some input from others and see how to set the meetup's course. Thanks for the offer to help!

Gluten-Free? So, I've read the food allergies, intolerances, and vegan/vegetarianism thread. I'm not vegan or vegetarian (insert Ode to Bacon here), but I have a severe non-Celiac gluten intolerance. With over 60,000 people in this course, I am betting that some of the others in this course will not allow the gluten-devil anywhere near their kitchens for fear of cross-contamination. :) With that in mind, does anyone want to do a virtual study group so we can hack the assignments to make them safe for us to prepare and consume? Let me know if you think it's a good idea and note where you would prefer this virtual alliance to be situated (i.e., Facebook, this course thread, Google Groups, time zone-appropriate Google Hangouts). I'm sure the easy way out would be to buy some all-purpose GF flour, but that doesn't exactly tell us what the different agents in it are doing.

The results are mostly proprietary but I can speak in general terms about the work I did. For instance the properties of individual flours and how they contribute to structure etc. Actually the only thing we are keeping proprietary are a few final formulations we developed.
Neutral
Study Groups
I would love to learn more! As a chemist, I'm thinking if we looked at the chemical structure of the important parts of regular bread and the chemistry of what happens during cooking, I don't see why we can't replicate that chemically without the gluten. We would have to find edible & of course tasty substitutes. Many people online say they are sensitive to Xanthan gum & other substances used to attempt to replicate the taste of gluten-containing products. Maybe there is a better way using chemistry instead of trial & error with different four mixes/ratios & gums etc. Maybe that is what you/your company already did. I would love to know everything you found that you are allowed to share!!
Neutral
Study Groups
I'm no chemist Brandy but I have reviewed dozens and dozens of papers on gluten free yeast leavened products from the Journal of Food Science and many other sources. We have a very good understanding of the mechanisms involved and how gluten (gliadins-glutenins) work to capture CO2 to develop crumb structure but finding an all purpose replacement is the issue. There are some outstanding formulations already out there but there are a couple of major roadblocks. One is shelf life. People who gravitate toward gluten free products tend to be more health conscious than the average consumer so the types of additives used to keep yeast products shelf stable to not play well. Second is nutritional content. Typically the ingredients that work best in gluten free preparations are ones that have minimal nutritional value. I think the Xanthan intolerance thing is way over played. People are paranoid about GMO products and corn is very much associated with GMOs. Being that Xanthan is corn derived I think people are making that association.
Neutral

Most of the work I've done with these kinds of flours has been pretty straight forward. The sweet potato flours work well in sweet desserts like sweet potato cake and other Afro-Caribbean type applications. There has been some work with cassava flour in dry pasta formulations. A lot of work coming out of Brazil with cassava flour. Of course you can use either of these flours to make Fufu. It's a great filling side dish synonymous with some African cuisines. Known by other names depending on the country but it's basically a thick porridge used both as a filler and a carrier to pick up food.

I don't think that intolerance levels are necessarily growing. I think it's more so that it is being diagnosed more now in cases that it wouldn't have been in the past. The growth of gluten free goes far beyond gluten intolerance and Celiacs though.

Before modern science, many things were classified as wasting diseases. People could see some differences (i.e., intestinal damage often creates visible signatures in human waste), but did not know the cause.

Beginning in the 1990s new proteins were engineered into our food supply, per the USDA, but no human trials were conducted to see if they were safe! What was added to the dairy & milk supply was not proven safe, so most of the world said we are not injecting those proteins & growth hormones into our cows. The USA said it has not been proven dangerous so we're going to forge ahead. :-(

The cravings mean that your body hasn't been 'weaned' off of wheat. For the first few months of being GF, the cravings are awful, but if you stick to it, they go away like magic. Thinking hard about what you want is also important. During my bread cravings period, I realized that I didn't actually want bread, for instance --- I just wanted the toppings. Same went for spaghetti. It also helps to avoid manufactured GF breads and pastas for at least 3 months. (Spaghetti squash and zucchini make great noodle substitutes in the meantime, and there are some great pound-cake quick bread things floating around on the Internet that you could try!) When comparing my experience to other GF people, it seems like those of us who waited experience much less disappointment with the substitutes.
Negative
Study Groups
cravings were terrible for me at first as well.. trick I used was every time I got a craving or would walk near the bakery section and smell the bread or whatever.. I would tell myself how that was really just very attractive rat poison. It smells nice to entice me to eat it, just like rat poison does to rats.. but, just like with the rats, it will kill me. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but it would be slowly, and for me, painfully, killing me. After a few weeks of telling myself this, even the smell of fresh baked bread would smell 'bad' to me. It's been over 2 years now since I've even been tempted to 'cheat' and I can tell fairly quickly if I've been CC'd, even just a little. Now, of course, if I want bread or crackers, I generally make them myself, and there are some great gf pastas, that even my non-gf husband likes (haven't found a bread recipe he really likes, but he and the girls wolf down the crackers when I make them..) I agree with giving your palate a few months off before trying some of the bread and cake substitutions, they don't really need to be a regular part of your diet anyway and they will taste different, and there are some that are better then others, but everyone has slightly different opinions on those :)

Gluten free for a little over 2 years, so I'm all for an on-going thread for suggestions in helping with some of the assignments. I also have issues with shell fish and alcohol so this is going to be an interesting class. Taking it for the experience and what info i CAN take from it, so grade doesn't matter as much to me. My dx was 'accidental' after doing a cleansing diet thing.. so is wasn't able to get proper testing before going gf, and when i tried to go back on for testing, I was horribly ill and nearly incapacitated in less then a week, so we called things off.. given my personal and family history, we're about 95% sure I have celiacs, but since we didn't do the testing, 'officially' I'm NCGS, also actually allergic to wheat. I haven't intentionally had anything with gluten since May of 2011 when I went back on for trial and potential testing, and anytime I get CC'd.. it's not a fun time for me.. migraines, joint pain, etc in addition to the gastric issues, so I don't cook with it anymore either. (Hubby and step kids still occasionally have gluten foods - pasta, bread and the like, but it is kept in a separate area and they have their own kitchen tools, toaster, baking sheets, etc..)

It might be worth getting the diagnoses Davina. I'm not sure what the situation is in other countries but in Canada if you are diagnosed you can write off the additional cost of gluten free purchases on your taxes. For instance if you purchase 60 loaves of bread over the year and a normal loaf of bread is $2.75 whereas the gluten free bread is $5.75 you can claim $180 as a medical expense.
Negative

Michael -- I also learned I was gluten intolerant from an elimination diet when I was between doctors. The amount of pain and GI upset from eating gluten products (which you have to be eating for several weeks for a test to show up positive) does NOT make a real diagnosis worth it, even though I know my health FSA at work would reimburse me for more expensive GF products. One of my sisters thinks she might be gluten intolerant or Celiac, and I'm trying to make her go get the blood test before she tries a GF diet because I don't want her to be caught in the same place.

If they have a poor vitamin status it wouldn't be because of going gluten free. That would be just poor diet choices or some other ailment. Foods that are cut out with a gluten free diet are not a great source of most vitamins to begin with.
Negative
Study Groups
Many people end up taking vitamin injections as they age (especially b-12). I have GI issues and gluten sensitivity (but I am not celiac), I used to have issues with iron and potassium... but I eat a full plant-based diet (vegan) with supplements during winter only and have had no issues since I switched to plant-based. I think what helps though is since I can't eat well in the morning without getting sick, I juice a lot of fresh vegetables (and when I do use supplements they are liquid). In my experience liquid supplements and real fresh juice is easier for your body to absorb... but I am sure, since everyone is different, there are exceptions.

Hi Mandi and Marta. I'm married to a German, though we live in Spain, but the first thing that I loved about home-cooking in Germany was that my Mum-in-law, Ana, would say: Carrots for supper, or cabbage, or savoy cabbage, or green beans... So, although almost all meals had some sort of meat component, the 'star' ingredient was almost always a veg. For example, Karottengemuese: Peel and dice a kg of carrots and about 2 potatoes, mix them in a large saucepan with some s & p and add some thick slices of good smoked bacon - push this down into the veg. Add water so it comes up to about 1 cm. from the bottom of the pan and cook till almost done. Mix about 1 tbsp cornflour with cold water and stir it in. Stir often - it will thicken with the pan juices (even if it sticks a little that will just enhance the taste). After a couple of mins., take off the heat and add lots of chopped parsley, adjusting seasoning as necessary. Marta, if you go to Munich, there used to be a great place for food in 'Im Tal', a pedestrian street downtown, where you buy your meat (eg delicious roast shoulder of pork with wonderful crispy crackling) at a counter and ask for the veg. you want to accompany it - my total favourite would be the sauteed potatoes (Bratkartofel) with pureed savoy cabbage Wirsing) - yummm. They had stand-up tables to eat at out in the street. Hope it's still there!!! Just tried to check it out on Google Earth and Google Maps, but can't locate it - maybe it's gone ;-( Have a great time anyway and hope you find some good local places to eat!

This is really interesting, in Denmark (northern neighbor to Germany) we also have a dish very much like that and with a similar name, Labskovs. I use leftover meat in dices, pork is the best in my opinion, dices/sliced cooked potatoes and onions - these are fried (in 2 or 3 batches), mixed and some leftover sauce is used to 'collecting' the tastes, and a fried egg and pickled beetroot/cucumber is served along with it. Some even add herring as in the above recipe, but I prefer without. I guess this is very old 'peasant food'.

I had low levels of iron in my blood since childhood. After the birth of my first child, the iron level dropped even lower, to the point where I would just lay down on the floor when I got home from work. Finally my doctor read about gluten intolerance, and noted that I had also complained of joint pain, which the article also noted as a problem with gluten intolerance. He suggested I give up gluten and see if that helped. (This was a long time ago - celiac was considered very rare, so I guess most doctors weren't aware of it.) Within three weeks, my iron level was up close to normal, and I had more energy. Looking back, I think that the ugly rash I had all during high school was caused by gluten.

Search Paleo Diet. The latest fad.
Neutral
Study Groups
Paleo is about eating whole, unprocessed foods. Eat animals that are humanely raised i.e., fed the foods they would normally eat in nature, allowed to graze freely and not raised on concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs), and eating fruits and vegetables that are grown without chemicals or are not GMO. It's that simple. The people who call it a fad diet don't understand it's more of a lifestyle than a diet. If eating whole unprocessed foods make you feel good, why would you go back to eating food that makes you feel like garbage?
Neutral
Study Groups
Actually Paleo is a far more detailed fad diet than what you describe. Most people have a very low understanding of what a true Paleo diet actually is. Hence it's popularity. There are so many variations out there people can pick and choose the one that they think is the easiest for them to use and still feel good about it.

Anyone in Wisconsin (milwaukee) I was wondering if anyone wanted to study/watch videos/conduct (no pun intended) the experiments together. I'm a pretty fun laid back person. Not bad looking either. HAHA.

Hi MIcheal, I missed the first week of class because I was not aware of this course until Tuesday. Do you think that so far it is adding value to your knowledge base or updating some info for you?

I teach biochemistry, bioprocesses, food chemistry and related matters at college level. I also teach biochemistry at high school level. I also write a blog on the same topics:

Hola Delia, I wish my Spanish was as good as my French so I could check out your blog. It doesn't look like the course may has many instructors like us, or at least they have not found this study group. I love teaching food chemistry and science, but not as much as eating.

I love eating too! In one of my courses, students had to plan a nutritious, balanced menu and prepare the dishes in the school lab. A lot of fun and a lot of good food!

That would be a very meaningful project to initiate, I just wonder if we can take this forum to kick start a dialog, receiving collection of recipes and suggestions from this diverse community? Love to hear your thoughts.
Neutral

Yes that would be very meaningful. Maybe we can approach hospitals that teach survivors how to mange their diets; invite patients to share their experiences with cooking to meet their specific needs?

Color vs. Taste Based on the assignment, I have determined what the connection is flavor wise to color, these would probably enhance any food containing them. Yellow: Bright, zesty, flowery flavor: Example: Turmeric, Lemons Red: Deep, Rich, or sweet Example: raspberry drinks, paprika, or meat Green: leafy, pungent, sour Example: Cilantro Blue: Bitter Example: Cleaning agents, soap Black: Deep, extremely powerful, burnt flavor Example: Charred meat, soy sauce, teriyaki glaze
