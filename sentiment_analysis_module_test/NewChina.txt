An Introduction to Science and Technology Studies, by Sergio Sismondo Wondering if there's an accessible copy of Sismondo within Coursera ? Don't particularly want to buy the whole book just in order to read p.1-11 next week. Did a google search, found several places that would let you read the latter part for free but can't get pages 1-11 except by sending off for the paperback version ?

Hi, I'm William P. (Bill) Hall. I'm a 73+ year old evolutionary biologist (PhD Harvard University 1973) with a background in physics, computing, epistemology. For the last 25 years of my organizational career I worked as a technical communicator, documentation manager (computer software and banking), and for the last 17+ years before I retired in 2007 I was a documentation and knowledge management systems analyst working for what was for a time Australia's largest defense prime contractor. In that role I was largely responsible for working out how to transfer the knowledge of how to maintain and support 10 ANZAC Frigates built for the Australian and New Zealand Navies. Solutions I designed played an important role in ensuring that this $ 7 BN project finished on time, on budget, with every ship delivered on time to happy customers and for a healthy company project - a very rare result in the defense contracting business. Since 2001 I have been working on a book on the co-evolution of and revolutions in human cognition and technologies that have a cognitive impact. To understand how organizations used cognitive technologies to support their activities I suspended work on the book for many years to research a number of issues relating to the theory and management of organizational (and other kinds of) knowledge.

Discrepancy between course outline and previously presented presentation video It seems to me that the video advertised much more than the course, part I, is offering. The Part I of the course was described as handling the basics, not only the first week. Secondly, this course seems to mainly treat the topic of innovation. Was the lecturer possibly forced to propose a broader title to Coursera or the university for his more specific interests? Please correct me, if I have the wrong impression.

I read the article as well as his follow up. Many of the things he said seems to be consistent with what I have learned from speaking with Chinese graduate students studying in the U.S. I believe your issue with his statements are the opinions attached to the facts - you don't seem to deny that there is deep rooted nationalism and a distrust of foreigners among Chinese. I don't believe the author meant to discount the history of China in making these statements, rather I think he was pointing them out as facts that now have implications for the success of modern Chinese society. For example, he mentions that the government embraces the concept of He, or harmony, in an effort to bring feelings of equality and peace between those with more and those with less. However, adherence to these social standards without consideration of fundamental economic and social theories can be problematic, as shown in his example of the Chinese housing market. The push for buying property is a result of a lack of financial security. This then leads to the phenomenon where the resource usage of one person seems small but when many people take similar actions, resources quickly become scarce. It is not the intention of an individual person to cause discord and only with a bigger picture understanding can it be avoided. Another example in which this can be seen, not mentioned in the article, is the disposal of industrial waste to surface waterways. It is in the best interest of Chinese factories to operate as cheaply as possible, but is it better for the Chinese people as a whole to have a booming economy with 10% inflation per year or to have clean air to breathe and clean water to drink? Chinese unity is not absent, just conflicted. On another note, as you were a student in the Chinese countryside, I'd be interested to hear your opinion regarding the education system, since the author is clear in his disdain for Chinese schooling outside of the major cities. I have also heard that school can be equivalent to a 'test center', as he puts it, but I have never been able to understand the concept of high marks in school in relation to survival as an adult.

Thank you Ken for your comment, It is of course a very good topic to write in our project, but it just made me really sad ever since I read about this story a few years back, I was astonished how this world would be like if Nicola could have popularized it. I think the problem is not only about societal overhead, but there is a fundamental conflict that both Nicola and Morgan cannot comes to terms with. Basically one is trying to make energy free for all, a philanthropist, while Morgan is a typical business person who have no interest in making a world a better place when energy is the biggest business anyone with money can do. If energy is free, the capitalistic world as we know it might comes to an end or close to it. There is really nothing they can compromise in my opinion. but then Nicola do need Morgan, one of the richest person to finance such greatest endeavour ... imagine you are talking about making electricity all around the world, and everyone can use it as it is impossible to put a meter on any person using it ... that will be like rain, or air ... how perfect is it?!?! Anyway ... it just seems impossible to achieve something like that unless he can finance the first one by himself and let everyone else to see what it is and hopefully there will be some more kind person, not for money, super rich, willing to do it for the mankind etc etc Actually, can I ask do you think there is another way that he can achieve a free energy dream? Just like penicillin? I would love to hear more ideas as I seem to be too stubborn and does not understand any other method .. :( best regards, Clement

Karl Popper Hello, all. Glad to be here. I just viewed the video on Karl Popper, and while it was educational, it was, in my opinion, not a revelation. Popper, like many theorists, had a few holes in his thinking, especially considering those who were listed as influences on his thinking. Perhaps I'm wrong, but the scientific theory requires an hypotheses, which is conjecture, or an 'educated guess'. The testing of that hypotheses, will lead to an outcome. If the hypotheses is incorrect, or not proven, the scientific method of inquiry requires a fresh start, another look. Would Popper deny the statistical method of the Null Hypotheses? Would Popper deny Einstein's Theory of Relativity which is the basis for Quantum Mechanics? Would Popper deny Marx's (and Hegel's) Theory of Thesis, antithesis, Synthesis? I believe that Popper, who was not unknown to me, simply came up with a new face for a process that goes back at least a millennium, and called it something different. Perhaps when he was studying the works of the 'Vienna School', he should have included Jung and Frankel, as well. Thanks for hearing me out. Harry

Dear William, Thanks for the response. I believe you're incorrect about Einstein's take on quantum mechanics. He remark about God was probably a joke, since he was a relativist about religion. You're also correct in that nobody has yet come up with a General Unified Theory, but Einstein did use quantum mechanics to prove that light bends traveling through space over time and distance. Thanks for your comments, and thanks for hearing me out,. Harry
Neutral
General Discussion
Howard, From memory Einstein actually won the Nobel Prize for discovering the quantum nature of light (i.e., that light was composed of particles called photons). However, he (and no one else, either) never managed to reconcile quantum mechanics (things like 'spooky' action at a distance due to entanglement) with relativity. Rather, he argued that there were hidden deterministic processes that could explain the apparently stochastic nature of processes at the level of fundamental particles. Einstein's understanding of the the gravitational bending of light had nothing to do with quantum theory. In Einstein's General Relativity this is explained by the interpretation of gravity as warps in the space-time continuum.

Hmmm. A choice between you and my professors and what they taught me. I think I'll stay with them, with all due respect, William, since two of them were/are Nobel Laureates.

Marx, as you doubtless know, was a German born in Trier, Germany, and did most of his work in London. Einstein was also German, living in Ulm and Stuttgart. Thanks for hearing me out. Harry

I think there are good reasons not to share technology especially those that relate to warfare and divination.

For the spreading of of Chinese Knowhow and culture (I consider science as part of culture) just look at the Chinese diaspora. Everywhere in Asia in Europe, America and even Africa the are descendents of Chinese Immigrants who brought along their culture and knowledge. Without them their new home countries would have missed out on advanced business and technological know-how.

I would say that ever since Jhang Hei made his famous voyage , the Chinese elite did not see the need to employ scientific knowledge to real world problems. That is why China missed out.

@Joseph Lemien China has a lot of coal. :) I often attribute the rise of Europe in general, and of England in particular to the rise of the Age of Enlightenment. Prior to that, the Church has a stranglehold on the intellectual environment, where absolutely obedience to the dogmas of the Church was required. With the rise of the Age of Enlightenment, that hold gradually loosened. The motto of the Royal Society, the first scientific society of the world and to this day, still the premier scientific society, is 'Nullius in Verba' - 'Not by the words of anyone.' That epitomizes the ethos of the era and of scientific development. Knowledge is to be gained by empirical experiments.

Student recommendations for good book on post revolution China In my youth, I considered myself reasonably informed on the (then) 30 years of post-revolution politico-economics of China, but i have forgotten much of it, and many of my sources undoubtedly tainted by Cold War US bias. We now have 30 years of perspective and additional history. Can anyone recommend a post-2000 book, available in the US, covering at least the 1950-80 era (preferably to the present). I'm asking students because I'm not really looking for a curriculum add-on. I'm just personally interested in updating my knowledge of an era I thought I knew

Why are dates in BC/AD rather than BCE? This is a question more for the course administrators than fellow students - I'm just curious why dates are given in the BC/AD Christian format rather than BCE/CE format. Is it simply because this course is in English and most native English speakers use BC/AD, or is there some detriment to using BCE/CE? I'm honestly curious - I'm a native English speaker and was surprised to see dates given in what, to me, seems to be a Western-centric format. Thanks!
Neutral

I'm not sure if this would count as a technology, but this might be a good example of a cultural/psychological lock-in effect anyway. I assume that BC/AD is used because that has been common in the English speaking world for a long time, and any change in resisted.

I've had this discussion often with lots of my friends in Beijing (both fellow expats and native Chinese)- one of the biggest problems we could see was that there is a barrier to SF in mainland China because the conceptual possibilities are too limited. In America and Europe, we can write stories that envision a future world where America or various European countries no longer exist- or are in a state of existence that is vastly different from the current status quo. We can make the president the bad guy- or one of his top generals- or put in a character who is a misguided police officer hunting down the intelligent hero who knows the secret that will save the world. We can imagine societal obstacles and use society as a driver for the main character's actions.

Your thoughts are noble, Felix, but unfortunately, I am not in a position to give you really concrete advice on this issue. Here in Hong Kong, there has been quite a lot of debate surrounding donations that individuals, groups, organizations and indeed even the HKSAR Government would like to give for earthquake relief. As I write this (11:52 am HK Time, Wed 24 Apr), a debate is raging in Hong Kong's Legislative Council about proposed HK$100 million in aid that the HKSAR Government would like to extend. The fear is that such donations fall into the hand of corrupt Mainland officials, and not into the hands of who actually need them.

As Chinese politics and society are so complex that they cannot easily be explained by traditional models, this discipline provides me with fresh and challengig insights.

Can the video lecture be cut into short pieces? When the internet connection is not stable, I always get stuck in the middle of a lecture, and have to refresh the page and start from the beginning (it seems impossible to jump to any timestamp). This is extremely troubling!!! Can the video lecture be cut into relatively short pieces like 5-10 minutes long? Other Coursera courses I take do so. If so, It won't waste that much time even if I have to start over again. I wonder if anyone else have the same concern?
Negative
General Discussion
Have you taken any other Coursera course? Try some mini-lectures please. It's really awesome, fitting into more flexible schedule. Plus, researchers have found that chopped-up materials are more easily to stay in the long-term memory of human's brain. I didn't believe either, until I myself tried some mini-lectures on Coursera (not every lecture is 5-10 minutes long of course, but most are). Short pieces of videos are indeed helpful of focusing on the key points, rather than distracting.
Neutral
General Discussion
2 or 3 minutes?! That's ridiculous! When I said short pieces, I meant 5 to 10 minutes indeed. Most video lectures I have taken or am taking on Coursera are around 10 minutes, and it feels pretty good. In fact this is all the time needed to talk about a certain topic. Long videos simply cover two or three topics in one. There're 20-min ones too (Prof. Sharif usually makes it 15 to 20 minutes). But when I think back weeks or months later, according to my own experience, those points explained in the mid-late period are just too dimmed to immediately recollect. Yet people seem to have incredibly great memory on the start and the ending, and chopped-out materials indeed promote the learning efficiency. Plus, the more specific topic a lecture focuses on, the easier it is to come back and check out a certain point in the future.

I share the opinion that the assignment required more than 250 words to be well done. It's hard to set the technological tim,e period, locale and develop the technological path including the divers of the 'lock-in' effect in 250 words. 500 would have been adequate.

Dear Prof Sharif:
Neutral
Assignments
Che King and others: My view is that the content is more important than length. So long as the odd essay is not *excessively* long (i.e. more than 500 words) it is fine. Even if the essay is more than 500 words long, you can mark it based on the first 350-or-so words (which should give you the gist of where the author of the essay is going anyway).
Neutral
Assignments
I've already submitted my peer evaluations. And, most sincerely, text lenght was not an issue for me. I'm on litterary studies, though. The probability of a superficial or an 'empty' long-lenght essay to leave an overall bad impression is huge. But on the other hand, a fine essay which in fact 'justifies' its whole lenght (every word is iseful) also should be taken in consideration. It's a case by case situation that seems hard to discuss abstractly, but gets clear when we face the concrete text. I didn't feel any need for this objective criteria (250-500). But that's just my opinion. All the essays I've read where really good. (Btw, my essay is around 300 words long. So I'm not advocating my own cause. :-) )

I just had a look at the first assignment I have to mark and it's about 750 words, obviously over the required 250. There's no real appropriate area in the rubric to deduct marks for length, though.

Negative

That's exactly the issue I have with it. When I submitted my assignment I found it quite difficult to edit it down and still be clear about the points I wanted to make, and I know a lot of people commented in the forum about how they wished the permitted word count was higher. Still, I don't like deducting points when this person has clearly fulfilled the components the prof highlighted in the rubric. Bleh. I'll take another look at it - I like your point about the actual content and style, if the author really needed the extra words or if he or she was taking advantage. Thanks for your input!

I have found that whenever I graded anyone who was waaaay over the word limit the essay had to be really good for me to believe it was on topic.

Thank you for your suggestion. Hope you can forgive for the fact that this is the first massive open online course offered by our university. We were indeed conservative as advised to give sufficient time for learning activities. Therefore the course was designed with the current schedule. Though there were comments from some students about the duration, it is never clear to see a consensus of change. Once the learning activities start, we believe that it is not a good idea to change the logistics arrangement (shortened a scheduled duration) in an online only learning environment to avoid unfairness and confusion to some students. Besides, changing settings to a started activities on Coursera is not advised. Hope you can understand.

250 words limit is itself a challenge. You are not writing a thesis. You have to write something concise and really get to the key point.
Negative

Writing a good essay of 250 is a challenge in itself, but doable. However, I do think that it's impossible to write a 250 word essay that is good enough to cover all the points we have to grade on 100%, especially since you first have to explain a little bit about your technology. If any of you have some good ideas to counter this problem, please let me know them.
Neutral

I agree, particularly on the point of explaining a little bit about the technology and the background. I'm struggling to come within 450!
Negative

I did try hard to stick to 250 words myself and appreciate that Coursera added the word 'approximately.' That being said, we're all taking this class because we want to learn and I don't think we should dock points on our evaluations for this unless the writer has gone over in an excessive manner.

now thats a good news :) by the way, I took history class last semester and the box for answers already had limitation so that anyone who tried over the 500 words (If I am not mistaken) could not put words more than that so the system already prevent to exceed words itself. I don't know whether this new coursera system do not have that kind of system.

There are models. I remember (vaguely, I take way to many courses) in one of the courses I took the professor discussed it.

How to upload/attach pictures to your assignments? I have started on assignment 2 and have made some diagrams to accompany my essay. I'm just wondering, because my coding and internet skills aren't the best, if it is possible to include these diagrams (.jpg format) as part of my essay. One solution I have thought of would be to convert my work into a pdf file and upload it somewhere like Scribd and then link it back to my submission. But there must be a way for the reviewer to access my work more conveniently, any suggestions/advice would be appreciated.

Assignment 2 Hi, Everyone In respect to the Assignment 2: It is asking me to ''Devise a non-linear model'' - does it mean that I need to CREATE my own model (or is my interpretation of the word ''devise'' wrong? :)
Neutral

Maybe there is a hint in one of the many lengthy lectures ... But if there is no non-linear model mentioned in the lectures we could write about, then probably we have to think of an alternative model ourselves.
Negative

There are other models but I believe if we devise a new one we are ripe for the Nobel prize.

My impression is if we critique the linear model (which is done in one of the lectures) and suggest improvements which are non-linear (feedback loops) we are by default 'devising' ...

Neutral
Assignments
What I would like you to do is to understand the linear model of innovation the best you you can. Think about it, reflect on it, and then propose an alternative to it. Yes, the linear model of innovation has shortcomings, but can you think of an alternative? And what about your alternative -- what are *its* advantages and disadvantages, both conceptually and in terms of operationalisation, as compared to the linear model that we've covered in lecture.

What puzzles me most is exactly ' and in terms of '...T_T So I check out wikipedia:

Yes, that is right. The important part is to get you to 'think' carefully about any new model you have in mind. How it compares/contrasts with the linear model, both in terms of the raw 'idea', and in terms of how you think it would fare if the alternative model you come up with is implemented.

Thank you. That's what I did -- I picked a 'different' approach, which I didn't really feel was superior, because I thought we were meant to come up with something ourselves, rather than discuss something that was covered in the lectures/reading. Though it had its advantages, I felt its weaknesses outweighed them, so I took the opportunity to make some philosophical points that weren't directly related to Linear. It was definitely my weakest essay of the three, but I feel better knowing the ai at least correctly understood the intent of the question, even if it (deservedly) doesn't score well. Alas, I'm sure it has long since been graded by many who may not have shared my interpretation (if I wasn't certain, why should they be?)

Thank you for your request (and willingness) to submit your Week 1 assignment late. As much as we would like to allow you to submit your work late, we are unable to do so. The main reason is consistency, to which the idea of fairness is closely related. We think it is important to be consistent to all students so that there are clear expectations not only for this assignment, but also for future assignments. Furthermore, by allowing a few students to submit their Week 1 assignment late, we stand to be accused of being unfair by students who may have gone through a great deal of trouble to meet the time crunch (i.e. submitted the assignment on time). We thank you in advance for your understanding (and sorry, once again).
Negative
Assignments
It seems rather unfair that 1. the deadline is so close to the start of each module 2. that we cannot submit and be penalised by a few points only 3. that there is no contact details where we could get attention immediately instead of waiting days and days and the issue compounding 4. There is no real reason for not allowing late entry , the processing would not have started immediately 5. This is not life threatening and no-one is going to be upset - only those of us who miss out. 6. And no I do no understand at all, we all went to a lot of trouble to complete the course, it is hardly fair that some tolerance is not allowed. This is hardly of momumental world significance !!!

I evaluated 10 assignments and gave 3 times the maximum points, because the essays were well written and made clear how the innovation related to the technological path and the lock in effect. Most essays showed the lock in effect using the customer side and I think that is perfectly valid, as shows this definition from Wikipedia:

In fact, according to the example in the slides (QWERTY), the lock in effect comes in the customer, rather than in the innovator. But, as you said, it is hard to see the difference, cause one usually implies the other.

Plagiarism, word count and peer assessment Hi all, I have just read and evaluated a few assignments from week 1 and most of them have been a pleasure to read and got some good examples of the 'technological path' and the 'lock-in effect', but I was wondering how to deal with plagiarism and heavily over-long essays. For example, 1 of the essays was approximately 440 words long, and of this only the very last paragraph was own content. The first 354 words very copied and pasted (word for word) from various Wikipedia sources, which were not mentioned or referenced. I suspect that the last paragraph was the author's own writing, as the writing style differed tremendously in quality and style. I deducted points for the over-length, and basically assessed the assignment on the last paragraph only. Needles to say, the author got a very low mark. I would like to emphasise, that I enjoy reading other peoples essays and can tell when someone made an effort, but plagiarising is dishonest and steels my time from evaluating someone who wrote an essay with their own thoughts and words. It would be great to get some feedback from the staff of the course regarding these issues and I also value thoughts from fellow course-takers. To enhance the coursera learning experience it would also be of help, if every evaluation of an essay had a general comment section, where we could address these issues, and to have a more clearly stated policy of how to deal with plagiarism. To anyone who actually took the time to think of innovation and research themselves, thank you for your contribution, I learned a lot from your examples. Cheers

There are websites that do that for you: Copycheck etc. Some are quite good, but if you are ever in a situation where you want to be absolutely sure, it would probably be best to search on some specific word groups that you extract from the whole text, that are unlikely to appear in the same way in many other texts
Positive

David Ewing: there are definitely ways to find out! Marloes mentioned one. Another basic one is simply to paste a sentence or part of a sentence in google in quotation marks. If websites with the exact quote comes up, it is plagiarized ...!

Just make sure you pick the most unusual text segments; a sequence of words that is unlikely to appear in that order in many other texts in Google. :) good luck!

I just got lucky. I thought the style seemed to change from paragraph to paragraph so I popped a couple of the sentences into Google and they showed up in the Wikipedia article. I guess if they're lazy enough to cheat they're probably using easily accessible information.

I just think there's a difference between absorbing things that other people have said and using them to validate your point, and copy-pasting what someone else has written about a subject. Where is the value in that? How does that demonstrate in any way that you have understood the idea and have something to contribute?

When grading their peers' work, if students come across clear examples of plagiarism, you are indeed being very kind to give a low score. We completely concur that submitted work that can be established beyond doubt to have been plagiarized should receive only a nominal score. Writing 250 words of your own thoughts should not be too onerous. In fact the idea is for this to be a challenging (not necessarily difficult) mental exercise. The spirit students should take in approaching this assignment should not just be to complete it for the sake of completion, but rather to reflect, contemplate, and think. That's the most important part of the exercise! The extent, depth and breadth to which you are able to reflect, contemplate and think will of course vary from student to student. But it is that *process* that is important; more important than the *outcome* (an aside: does reading this make anyone recall the material on Popper that the instructor covered early in the class?)

I thank you all for useful information about checking trial of plagiarism. I fully agree with you that 'percorso' (path) is more important than the 'final goal'.

That's why I can't imagine anyone blaming you for using and quoting sources! That is not plagiarism. I think what everybody here is referring to, is people using online sources out of laziness or lack of time and trying to pass it off as own work. So no need to worry about anything for you, I would say! Or do you feel you were penalized for it in the grading? I can hardly imagine; that would seem wrong..
Negative
Assignments
Just a side note: please see if it's a citation instead of plagiarism. I meant, if the writer is quoting or referencing to certain source to establish some points in his/her essay, it's not a plagiarism (well, it would be excellent if he/she also attaches his/her sources also).

Thanks for commenting. You're right. But it's a huge task to prove the plagiarism. Specially when the author uses many sources. I've heard there are apps that generate alternate texts based on sources, using synonims to make it harder to identify and prove the plagiarism. I've taken your comment in consideration and re-evaluated the texts. From the 9 I've graded, just 1 had serious evidences of plagiarism (I've originally said it was 2, but I've reconsidered). Fair proportion, since plagiarism is quite epidemic... I guess we should start trying to re-think our model of 'academic' writing. In a not so far away future it'll be virtually impossible to detect plagiarism.

I'm truly honored to hear -- and I'm not kidding -- that you've spent many an hour on this assignment. More power to you! That said, I hope the hours you've spent haven't caused you too much frustration either. So here's the thing: if there was an approach that weren't as diffuse, as all-encompassing as the innovation systems approach, and that alternative system was more focused on say, one (or two) components of the innovation system (you can decide what those components are), that you felt were the *most* important in an innovation system (again, it is for you to decide which component deserves heavier weighting as compared to the others), would you not get more traction out such an alternative approach (as compared to the innovation systems approach)? Would such a more targeted approach not allow you to get to the 'heart' of the matter without having to expend valuable resources on factors that *could*/*perhaps* have an impact on innovation in an economy, but perhaps only marginally? Does that help, Katherine?

Thanks for starting this group and I hope we all will help each other to have exciting learning experience!

Cool) Why are you interested in EE? Are your parent's from here?
Neutral
Study Groups
Thanks for asking. I do not have any EE ancestry (Welsh/Irish/Native American) However, I have always had an interest in EE. I think it was a product of growing up in the cold war. I traveled to the USSR in 1989 as part of a student exchange, expected to be a Soviet Studies expert in college; and when the USSR came apart, my studies switched to Philosophy and History. Nonetheless, Comparing my Western European ideas about science and the Enlightenment to China will be fascinating, but being able to expand my experience in this course to include an Eastern European perspective on the topic is an unexpected bonus.

Immaneul Kant made a distinction between Eastern and Western European Enlightenments in his 'What is the Enlightenment?' when he described Frederick the Great as the most enlightened leader in Europe. Consider the quote 'Argue all you will about what you will, only obey!' which he ascribed to F's style of handling the enlightenment. In light of the first weeks topic- 'The social dynamic in science' is there a uniquely East European social arrangement that considers science to be in the service of the political structure- in the same way that Kant bragged about it in Frederick's Prussia? Western Europeans often brag that their scientists are independent of politics, and Eastern scientists are beholden to theirs.' Is any of that accurate, or is it just prejudice?
Neutral

Which is what I am wondering- in the West science has been traditionally independent of state sponsorship (until 20th century) and even now with modern realities is always trying to maintain a separation between science and state. Great example of this is D Eisenhowers farewell address where he warns of among other things, the time when research grants from government will dictate the direction of science. Westerners believe science is best and most free when conducted privately and independently from state.We even think it is best when separated from technology itself. We tend to believe science for science sake is different than science for technologies sake. Prussia, Russia lacked private resources and patrons of science and when state leaders wanted western technology they put up their own resources and thus science came into existence as an arm of the state and for the express purpose of supplying technologies. Considering the tendency towards 'enlightened absolutism' of Russia and Prussia, science and rationality within the context of state absolutism- has that had a lasting effect on science in modern Eastern Europe? Is it too simple to say Western science is built on science for science sake and Eastern science is built on science for state and technologies' sake?

Sorry to hear about your daughter. I was diagnosed about 8 years ago. Support groups are around, and quite good, I think. I personally avoided them for a long time, because everyone at them seemed so old. I recently attended a group for the first time in years- I was still the youngest person there! Boy, did that make me mad! Even at the young Parkinson's meeting, 8 years after diagnosis, I am still the youngest! I think this rage is what keeps us out of groups. I for one think the groups are important and potentially helpful- even when you are alot younger. So now I'm trying to make it to meeting. Please feel free to pass on my name to your daughter. Good luck to her and you both.

Neutral

Hi Natalia. So far it's good. The study requires a lot of patience and time. The pronunciations can be difficult in the beginning, and it's also difficult to remember all the characters. I forget a lot of characters if I don't practice them everyday or every other day. But it's a nice feeling when I can read a whole text or dialogue with characters - or even understand some words/phrases when I watch Chinese movies. You don't have to be anxious - it will be difficult in the beginning, but when you have learned Chinese for some times, it'll hopefully be easier! (-:

Easy buddies, this post is simply to check how many Chinese students enrolled in this course, since cousera is not so popular in mainland China. And we think it's great to have Chinese natives in this course because it's related to our culture and that's it. We're not discussing something in Chinese, so don't worry about that, like other posts which are written in Spanish or Dutch, I believe it's a bonding thing within one culture.

'Some technologies promote inequality' In Section 1.6 'Introducing Technology' it is mentioned that one possible characteristic of technology was to promote inequality. This is certainly true but technology can also promote equality. An example of of this technology would be public school systems, which may vary in quality from school to school and from teacher, do promote mostly an equal access to education.
Neutral
Study Groups
MOOCs technology certainly provides a degree of equality to the education sector.
Positive
Study Groups
When it comes to inequality and equality many things can go either way. Even education, since children with special needs will not receive the same education. So, it is not just dependent on the school, but also the opportunities in the community, disabilities, and such. Also, by saying that there is a difference in the quality of the school it is saying that there is inequality.
Neutral
Study Groups
It is true that technology can evoke inequalities, since not everbody has the same access to technology due to financial or legal restraints. Example: HIV medications is not available for a lot of people living in Subsaharan African countries. Therefore it is necessary that supra national goverment organization (UN etc) make access possible throughout the world. In other words to globalize technology access and to create a level playing field.

I'd say that you needed look further than your own home or even your pockets for a good example of technology that follows a path and employs the lock-in effect. Take credit cards for example. They have been around for a long time and portray similar characteristics with each iteration and have created a standard. A non-standard sized card would not fit in to a normal wallet nor a card holder. Look at the path from magnetic strip to chips to 'contactless' technologies. The data on a magnetic strip can be wiped if it sits on your smart phone for too long, so why still have them? There's the lock-in effect!

I should have stated it pricisely. It is not about downloading video in other format - you have to stream it directly from Coursera page (similarly like you are on youtube page when you watch youtube video). Try watching segment 1.4. directly on videos page - inside video progress bar (around 3.15) you should see yellow vertical bar indicating there is a quiz. At this moment during lecture quiz will pop up. Keep in mind that not every video in this course has quiz. Let me know if it worked.

QWERTY was NOT designed to slow typists Though it remains a suitable example of lockin, and other keyboards (notably non-flat layouts) do offer advantages, the main studies discrediting its speed, attributed to the US Navy, were in fact performed by one Lt. August Dvorak, who invented a leading competitor. Historically, the lock-in occurred in an era when typing competitions were extremely common and heavily influenced purchase decisions. While some key layouts may reproduceably have some advantage (in typing English) after retraining and practice, none of these has much more than 2% advantage, and most are close to 1%. The QWERTY keyboard, for better or worst, has proven to be close to optimal, and this is no accident, since its predominance followed its success in typing competitions. The still-common myth of QWERTY's deliberately slowed design was formally debunked in the literature over 20 years ago. References: Liebowitz, Stan J. and Margolis, Stephen E., The Fable of the Keys.

Link tag not working correctly The problem summary: When properly implemented, the link button and URL tag should produce a hyperlink on a passage of anchor text -- i.e. the anchor text should appear in a format that indicates that it is clickable, and should indeed be clickable. The URL tag and URL are not directly displayed (though most browsers will display the URL of any link you mouse over at the bottom left window margin as a security check for the user). I have seen this work correctly on many Coursera forums, including some within the past 24 hours. However, in this forum, the hyperlink appears and is clickable, the URL tag itself is [inappropriately] visible and the URL tag fails to make the anchor text clickable This happens whether the URL tag is typed or entered through the Link button.

Just to be clear, I'm not against a box for references. However, if one is added then expectations go up. Probably the rubric would have to be revised to discuss the role/merit/weight/strength of references. It definitely gets more difficult both to do the assignment and evaluate it. I'm not opposed to that, but it is probably inconsistent with the estimated workload of the course on its homepage.

Mispronunciation of 'suffice' It's a very minor issue, but since we can report typos, I figured I'd report a mispronunciation which has popped up regularly. In 'suffice it to say,' a figure of speech which appears quite a few times in the lectures, the '-ice' in 'suffice' should be pronounced like 'ice,' (as in frozen water) rhyming with 'mice' and 'nice.' 'Suffice' should not rhyme with 'this', 'miss', or 'hiss.' You can hear the word spoken correctly here:

It's not about the structure of a course. It's about the structure (or design principles) to organize and present the course material having the learner at the center. Like length of video (not after but before opening: at a glance). Like slides with page numbers and lecture chapter in footnotes. Like videos giving a clear view of the slide content (not of the presenter). Like editing videos to remove clutter. Why make a technically or didactically mediocre course when you can make a good one? Look at the good courses at coursera: none of them are boring even if they show the videos' length.

In theory they could be refuted if we had a time machine, to actually observe sequences of speciation and divergence. We don't have this ability yet, so genomics provides the gold standard against which all other classification hypotheses can be tested.

So, give me an ironclad definition of a species that works in cases. 'Modern phyletic classifications based on morphological, behavioral,  biochemical or other phenetic approaches are eminently falsifiable using  genomic data.' So, specify a test that would falsify it. Note. I am not saying I disagree. I think you are too glib in your claims.
Neutral

Popper says that science is all about the theories and not the results, that scientists should try to refutes theories, that the scientific method doesn't prove what's true (only what's false: falsification), and all theories are temporary. What you guys are describing doesn't sound like it fits the bill - no crucial experiments, and you are arguing that genomic classifications are based on solid evidence. Popper doesn't care if they are true or not, he cares about the theory used to get there. By Popper's definition, classifications themselves are not science, theory is.

As I have noted in several posts, Dr Sharif badly misrepresents Popper's thinking in several places. In this Sharif follows a school of philosophy that wrote Popper off and stopped reading his books before his thinking fully matured. In his later work Popper argues that it is impossible to prove any hypothesis true or false. However, he does care very deeply as to whether a given hypothesis is a realistic (or reliable) predictor of the real world, and argues that science should be concerned to differentiate between better (i.e., more reliable predictors of nature) and worse ones (i.e., those that have been shown to be in error).

So, point us to one. Perhaps my education is lacking, but I thought that what we essentially know is that the coding for many proteins is highly conserved, but we cannot rule out that, say, God did it that way for his own inscrutable reasons. However, in the spirit of proposing a falsification test, let's consider R = H^2 S. If, after applying a Selection Differential of 0.5 SD for a bunch of generations for a trait that we know has high heritability (say H^2 = 0.8) and there no change in the population mean after those generations then we have some explaining to do, because it would seem to falsify the power of selection.

How is falsification different from supertition? Hi, This may be an offbeat question, but 'how is falsification different from supertition?', as both makes risky predictions and then either could be falsified.
Negative
Lectures
Hi Rosalyn, thank you for starting a thread, but i have this point-of-view. As per falsification, one need to predict a theory first and then look for evidence to support it. Isnt it the same case in superstition, as there is a firm believe supported by guesses. And in later stage, the myth of superstition burst if any deviation is observed from superstitious believe. Same with falsification, if the evidences are not confirmed then the theory is rejected. I am trying to point out the similarity in superstition and falsification and similarity lies in proposing theory at first followed by hypothesis.

Lecture 1.3 - Popper's rigid concept of falsification At the outset, although I am criticizing Dr Sharif's understanding of Karl Popper's works, I have no disagreement with the main points he is working to make about the nature of the scientific method and the differences between scientific and pseudoscientific or magical thinking. From the point of view of the epistemology of science and technology and the roles of Karl Popper and Thomas Kuhn in it I am a peer - which is not why I am taking this course. I know very little about the sociology of science and technological development - where I will very definitely be his student.  However, the picture of Karl Popper's thinking that Dr Sharif presents in this segment is based on a 'paradigmatic view' that I believe is received from traditional academic philosophers - who basically made up their minds about what he thought and stopped following his works with his 1963 book, Conjectures and Refutations. Most scientists would also have received this view, given that very few have ever studied epistemology (the theory of knowledge) first hand.  The fact is that Popper's thinking about how knowledge could be made reliable did not stop with Conjectures and Refutations. In his 1972 Objective Knowledge and later works (almost all of them dealing with epistemology) Popper accepted (although not very explicitly) many of the criticisms against his previously 'rigid' approach and developed a much more realistic understanding of the processes. I think these views would be very relevant to the argument Dr Sharif is developing. Popper's further works developing these views are:  My own relevant works on theoretical and applied epistemology (downloadable from the Web) are:

Lecture 1.4 - Major misunderstanding of what Popper meant by 'objective knowledge' Dr Sharif perpetuates an assumption many philosophers who have not read or at least have not understood Popper's later works have made about what Popper meant by 'objective knowledge'. To equate Popper's term with knowledge that is somehow considered to be 'objectively' true and therefore 'scientific' could not be farther from the truth. In his 1972 book 'Objective Knowledge - An Evolutionary Approach' he argues that no claim to know can be considered true because all such claims are cognitively constructed inside our mind and can never be objectively tested against reality because all of our perceptions of the world are based on bodily processes that turn any contacts with the real world into nervous signals and sensory impressions that physically cannot in any way exactly represent objective reality. We only learn about the external reality through speculation, constructing tentative hypotheses, criticizing or acting on them, and throwing away claims that our internal cognitive processes were false. What we should follow are those theories that worked by comparison to those that clearly did not. By iterating this process many times our understanding of reality will gradually come closer to the unprovable truth. Popper always discusses his concept of 'objective knowledge' in the context of his ontological domains of 'three worlds', where world 1 (he never capitalizes these) is the world of physical reality that includes the physical world and everything that happens in it without interpretation or understanding. World 2 is the world of cognition and other living processes and what he calls 'situational knowledge' and what I call 'living knowledge'. World 3 is the world of ', which is knowledge that has been (and is) codified into the inert structure of . Examples of objective knowledge (in Popper's sense) include knowledge alphabetically encoded in words on physical sheets of paper, magnetic domains on the surface of a magnetic disk, + and - polarizations in the surface of a memory chip, pits in the metallic film inside a CD, or even the sequence of nucleotides forming a DNA molecule. Where the growth of scientific knowledge is concerned, objectively expressed knowledge is valuable because it is subject to criticism, testing and review by other minds than the original creator who can substantially increase the reliability of surviving knowledge through their stringent elimination of errors. My colleagues and I have described the role of objective knowledge in the Popperian process of scientific error elimination in the following papers that can be downloaded by clicking the links: A comparatively simple graphic summarizes the social process:

I have a major concern with the BMW Analogy There is no sense in which knowing about the BWM 7 series can allow us to make more accurate predictions about the world than knowing about the BMW DIXI could. However, knowledge of oxidation in chemistry allows us to make much more correct predictions than the Phlogiston theory does. Knowledge of special relativity allows us to make much more accurate predictions than Newtonian Mechanics does. Here, I am deliberately referring to two different types of advances. In the case of phlogiston, it was just wrong. In the case of Newtonian mechanics it is useful in a great many circumstances but breaks down at the extremes.

Karl Popper, Part II I've just finished lecture 1.3, where the professor, while not debunking Popper's work, necessarily, does point out the many flaws. For example, if Popper was so concerned about the method more than anything else, did he ever wonder why method inevitably produces outcomes? What would Popper think of the double-blind study or survey? Lastly, all of my life, I've always held the belief that science drives the tech. It certainly does in my line of work. I wonder what Popper would think of that. Opinions are more than welcome. Thanks for hearing me out. Harry

Naomi, I have a profile online here with Coursera, but I'll spare you the agony and just answer your question. I'm a professional soldier, currently in Qatar/Kuwait after four consecutive years on the Iraq/Afghanistan merry-go-round. I have a BA in History from the University of Pennsylvania (not Penn State), and an MS in Administration and Leadership from Clemson University. Leopold von Ranke, a great historian, who trained numerous American historians, once made the remark, 'History is just one damn thing after another.' I agree; it does have that inexorable quality to it. While I can do without the upper case letters, I get your point, except your social construct=market need remark, especially after the lecture slides on innovation, invention, etc. I will agree to the change is the only universal inevitability maxim, as well. But there is also Choice Theory out there, and people have to decide if they need 'risky' tech like electrical cars, or smart phones as opposed to just regular old cell phones.

Kuhn Hello, all! I just finished the work of Kuhn, with whom I'm more familiar. He is one of those giants in his chosen field (physics), that one doesn't always hear about. I also found him to be less idealistic and rigid than Popper. I believe he is correct about paradigms, a word that gets thrown around quite a bit, especially by my misguided peers that get MBAs. I can go the rest of my life without hearing the word again; every briefing I attend, it will be used at least 5-10 times. I also like his take on historical perspectives and accounting for history very much. As my grandmother used to say, 'once is an accident; twice a coincidence; three times is a trend. Pay attention.' I think this fits in nicely with Kuhn. I also like the idea that the shift isn't recognizable while it is going on. Of all the Presidential elections in US history, for example, only about 6 or 7 are considered as a shift, or a game-changer: 1824, 1860, 1916, 1932, 1960, 1980, 2008. Nobody knew what would happen with those elections, with the possible exception of 1860. I think it also points out that the one thing about change, in a very existential sense, is that it is a universal constant. Thanks for hearing me out. Harry

Screw drivers, the reality I was disturbed to hear Prof/Dr Sharif's description of the use of a screwdriver. I suspect he has not used one much. There are two types of screwdrivers available these days. The more traditional type with a fixed head/grip and the newer type with a ratchet in the head/grip. Now. I rarely use a power grip on a screwdriver unless it is exceptionally difficult to drive the screw in. And in any event, with a traditional screwdriver you have to disengage the screwdriver from the head of the screw, rotate the screwdriver back and then re-insert the blade or operational end into the screw head, and apply rotation again. If you are using a power grip (or indeed any other grip) and you simply loosen your hand and rotate your hand the blade of the screwdriver will fall out of the screw and you are actually likely to have the screwdriver fall out of your hand. With the ratchet type, there is no need to take your hand off the screwdriver nor any need to disengage the screwdriver from the screw, as long as you have the ratchet set for the correct direction. Details matter.

You are right, there are (theoretically) several ways of manual screw driving. It depends on context: size of screw, size of driver, flatness of wall to screw vs. screw-in-a-hole; whether you can use your left hand (lets assume you are right handed) to support the driver while having to turn your right hand in order to avoid having to disengange the driver.

In modern as well as traditional China, long fingernails (usually for men, and usually just one per hand) signifies that you are not a manual laborer, and thus that you enjoy some level of cosmopolitan or intellectual lifestyle.

So, count on the help of all to overcome this challenge. As I understand it, according to the conception of Popper, scientific theories arise from hunches and which only become science because there is the possibility of being falsified, even if this can not be proved. The point here is not to take science as static truth, but to understand it as something that is always evolving.

Could that actually be a good example of how the lock-in situation of cars being traditionally safeguarded through the use of locks, can perhaps be broken by innovative but unintented ignition of a crisis? Furthermore, who knows whether scientists behave that way on low days... That said, first of all I'd say all technology before the age of science is clearly not derived from science. And technologies arrived at haphazardly or fortuitously aren't either. It's just that science has made them all a part of its history and pre-history. By the way, if I am not mistaken many of the latter non-science-originating technologies were invented by individuals, before the shift to large teams and companies. Many conclusions can be drawn from this...

One of the things I think isn't made clear is that Popper's definition of 'discarding the theory' doesn't necessarily mean starting with a completely new, unrelated theory.

The concept that 'technology is derived from science' is described in the lineal model (Vannevar Bush - science the endless frontier).

This depends on how you define science. If you discover a way to make gunpower, probably by trial and error and repeat refinement, is that consider science? For me I think science is more than this.

The 'why' question is probably too academic to them.

I would say we can speak of 'science' with respect to ancient times, but I don't think anyone would call the sages and alchemists of antiquity scientists.

Are scientific theories really useful to the society without being applied through technology? In one of the videos, the lecturer mentioned that technological innovations do not necessarily have to have a scientific basis, I am wondering if any scientific knowledge or theory can be useful to society if not applied through technology
Negative

There are a huge number of scientific theories, particularly in the humanities, that either explain, illuminate or guide behaviour without technology. For example there are a number of theories that help us understand anxieties, structure workplaces, explain how money moves and how continents move. These may use technology but haven't caused any.technological development.

I agree that 'OK' can be used as a divider between parts of a presentation. I am not referring to the word 'OK', but to the question 'OK?'. I believe that 'OK?', as if the speaker was asking the audience a question, is superfluous.

These OK's are indeed superflous. But the lecturer chose to be filmed in real time when talking (and sometimes just reading slides). Since he didn't take time to edit videos, we witness a lot of rethorical weaknesses, excuses for mistakes when juggling between scrolling vs. underlining on his iPads (I have seen 3 so far, a white, a silver and a black one), repetitions of statements for emphasis, OK's for asking feedback - which can't come in MOOC's like in a classroom.

The price has nothing to do with it. MOOCs have the advantage that by post editing you can improve the lecture style, cutting out errors, taking out the stress of talking in front of a live audience standing on a center stage, bridging over concentration gaps. Look at other coursera courses: all that I took have a full view of the slides and a small video window at a corner with the talking head (sometimes moved to another corner or deleted if it blocks the view on some slide content). Put the content into the center, not the presenter. Technology is cheap and makes it easy to improve a lecture. No personal habit must be standardized or pressed into a boring mould. Think of it as a lock-in situation where the lecturer thinks that lectures must be lecture hall talks in full sight as was usual in the last couple of centuries. Sure: 'It would not be perfect in real life either.' So why would you want the lecture to be as if in real life? Especially, if you can make it better? It's not that I don't 'appreciate the great effort and contribution of Dr. Sharif and his team to this course'! Just want to give hints to other courses that used technology way better.

Are Chinese from China starting to engage in linkages of a new type? Many/most modern products require software. There are a lot of Open Source Software projects out there, and these include people from many companies and universities. This results in a very large amount of cross-pollination between companies universities and it occurs largely at the level of individuals. Google also runs projects called The Google Summer of Code, where Google will fund university students to work on open source software projects over the summer. I have noticed that this year, for two of the Open Source Software projects that I am involved with, there are now Chinese students who are applying to take up summer projects. I have also noticed that there are more and more Chinese-named people involved with Linux, perhaps the premier Open Source Software project. Does this suggest that we will see an acceleration of computer-based innovation from China?

You just leave scientific practice out. When science is defined as knowledge and method and not as a practice, the social aspects of science are disregarded and the role of the scientific community minimized. Kuhn introduced them, although he didn't believe science was only a social activity, he also embraced the cognitive value of science. Let us not forget that the Structure was first written as part of the Enclyclopedia of Unified Science.

I have the same opinion as you do. Science is a path to describe events that we observe. So we apply methods trying to match numbers and letters with the resulting events. And having a set of coincident results we call it theory, otherwise we would step toward another paradigm. So i think we can't even precisely describe Science because our observations are simply interpretations, depending on several factors of humans and the environment. So the missing part of 'scientific method' is the social part observations plus the randomness of the events and probability analysis.

Obvious answer would, presumably, be that definition of science as scientific method neglects social aspects of science.

The problem with your point is that people such as Popper think there is only one correct method and that knowledge produced in other forms is pseudoscience.

Maybe I didn't express my point clearly enough - I think that concept of scientific method is highly contestable, but nevertheless it is the best line of demarcation we have (so far) between science and other forms of knowledge.

In the humanities the scientific method needs to apply falsification , not experimentation. We call this the HERMENEUTIC model, the theory and methodology of interpretation. What do you think, does Popper and Kuhn incorporate the model of hermeneutics in their thinking?
Neutral
Week 1: Definitional Issues
In my opinion Kuhn's model of scientific revolution is completely applicable to social science and humanities. Popper's falsification, if simplified in terms that you have to formulate hypothesis if you want to do science, is also quite compatible with hermeneutics (and other methods employed by social science). However, I'm not sure how useful are his notions of 'risky predictions' and 'crucial experiment' in context of social science.

@Talib I believe that terminology Popper uses might be the major problem here (in relating his ideas to social science): predictions and experiments. You did a good job, in my opinion, trying to translate these terms and relate them to social science, but if we are to draw our understanding of science only in terms of edge cutting theories or major breakthroughs, there will be not much of science left. This fits better within Kuhnian framework of paradigm shift (which does not leave everything in between out).

Yes, I agree with you Naomi, that the scientific method ignores the social construct of the issue. However, if science is tinged with politics, it might be bent like what Nazism did, arguing with psuedo-scientific language on the superiority of the Aryan race, or like Lysenko did, based on Communist ideology, on the inheritability of behavior traits. The scientific method, as expounded by Popper, would keep the methodology devoid of socio-political-religious bias. Admittedly, as human beings, we tend to see things within the framework of our own culture and background, but the scientific method, being open to debate and verification by different people, hopefully will minimize those errors. If one reads scientific papers of whatever discipline, one would find in general very specific details of the method of setting up of the experiment or study. This is to enable other scientists to replicate the study and see whether he can replicate the results, and if another scientist, following the same method, get a different result, then that result is in doubt. (The endless debate regarding the usefulness of alternative medicine came from the lack of replicability of the results under the very strict controlled condition of double blind clinical trials.)

I think that the definition 'scientific method' demonstrates only instrumental dimension of science, without pointing to human, cultural agencies. Scientific method is more about deduction, induction, sampling - about different ways of collecting and analyzing the data, while science itself is more complicated and depends on the curent context (societal, scientific, etc.). Scince goes beyond certain paradaigms or theories, which are the outcomes of certain scientific methods, and represents a dynamic body of more or less systematized objective knowledge in its evolution within certain context.

The problem with not defining science by seeing whether the study that's labelled as 'science' is really following the scientific method is that the body of knowledge so derived could be entirely wrong.

When reading An Introduction to Science and Technological Studies by Sergio Sismondo. He writes a definition of science that I believe says it all ' Science is a formal activity that creates and accumulates knowledge by directly confronting the natural world.' The scientific method enhances or dismisses what the natural world has shown us. The issue with defining science as the scientific method is that, the scientific method starts by asking a question, then research, a hypothesis, testing and such.

Is good this argument. I want to say that not always you need a method to get new knowledge, Imagine you are 4 years old, so you want to rest down of an apple tree, and one apple falls on your head, you injure, and you will know that apples are tough. And if you bit apple you will know is juicy. And you never followed a procedure or method to know that apples are tough and juicy. Never plan a procedure to wait a falling apple to hit your head. It was just an accident. But if you are curios about what are those red things, you will get near of the tree and think how to get one. So, find a rock, and throw to the tree, you couldn't hit one. What is next? We plan another way to get one, find a branch to pull of the apple and get one. So, you touch it, is tough?, you see, oh yes. it is juicy? let`s taste. Oh yes. How it is called this thing? and you will know if you ask to your parents. And that is more knowledge for you. Summarizing, Scientific Method, is the second example, trying to find knowledge by trial and error. Trying to know more, so we do a range of activities to catch it. In other hands, sometimes knowledge comes to us as a hit in the head by an apple.

As science is never conducted in vacuum and is to certain extent affected by dominating social values, the dirrection of research can be strongly impacted by goals that the given society has.

The scientific method is a linear process in which conjectures on how the world works can be formulated. As many have others have stated, social implication are often removed from hypothesis testing; that's just good science. Conjectures were made all throughout the European Dark Ages, and many ideas could be tested. The problem is that society limited the scope of topics to investigate. Under this idea, the scientific method is an effect of societies whim. This is good science, but it is also incomplete science. Furthermore, testability can be corrupted to justify a particular social idea or scientist's own personal gain.

Besides one of the problems with Kuhn's ideas mentioned in the lecture regarding the relationship between the two paradigms can be explained by the analogy between a paradigm and religion. Thus, like religions, paradigms might share multiple common points but it's impossible to hold both of them at the same time as they uncompromisingly contradict each other. So the method suggested by Kuhn seems to better correspond with the ways in which scientific knowledge was gained over the course of centuries rather than the one suggested by Popper.

In my opinion, after see all the video lectures posted and trying to understand rationally both Popper and Kuhn theories, I believe that is not necesary seek other words to complement them or analyse whether there is sourcing shortages and so on. I think the question is if really each one understand duly this thread, this issue. Sincerely, even though seems contradictory, I do not believe the best method is to focus in the area of these two philosophers or/and sociologists, if not reconsider the main ideas that concern us. The definition of science that is suggested is clearly wrong for one reason, 'Science encompass corroborable and not corroborable ideas' and the scientific method, of course, only works with all of the ideas that can be tested, accept, reject, analyze or falsify. Science is a set of knowledge extracted from observation and reasoning that allows formulate general ideas and principles deduction, but not all can empirically tested. This is the mistake. The logic or the oversized matematics, for instance, are a type of science that is not possible to justify or confirm experimentally because it is impossible to reproduce them tangentially. For this is wrong defining science the 'scientific method'. On the other hand, regarding all the other kind of science, it is very easy to confuse both terms since for all of them may exist an empirical demonstration. Is in this part of the disambiguation where come into play Karl and Thomas.

The definition of scientific method is obtained in a logical abstraction, not only valid under any set of logical inferences but it also valid from the intuitive point of view. But with a lack of sense from a social standpoint. I mean a society in a given time not only has different value judgments but it also makes different statements on the same issue is not time-dependent phenomenon. So I think it should be cavities in the scientific method to a socio-temporal dimension.

Science should allow its practitioners, the Scientists to define it in whatever way they practice it. It should not go the way of philosophy where questions are often asked where there are no answers. Be careful that scientists do not fall into the philosopher's trap and become irrelevant.

I agree with you. As a matter of fact, scientific method is a process to derive a theory. The most important essence of science is the mind. The mind helps us build the framework of the scientific theory. In addition, not all science is ethical. Take for instance, atomic bombs have claimed multiple lives and wreaked havoc during the Second World War.

Speaking from an anthropological stance, the relativity of culture makes it improbable to make a completely objective theory. One is always burdened by societal factors that contributes to biases for or against a theory.

In regards to being locked in to something inferior, how about mp3? The WAV format for audio offers much better quality. At the time of the mp3 revolution, not everyone had super-fast internet to download WAV files that are on average 100 times larger than mp3s. Nowadays, with fiber-optic internet and music players with huge storage capacities, why are we still using mp3? Is it because we are locked in? Would deviating from this path mean failure for companies (as most people wouldn't assume that WAV is an audio file just by looking at it)? I hate to answer a questions with questions but I think its relevant here! Hope this helps!
Negative
Week 1: Definitional Issues
I think that one of the problems with considering such things as mp3 to be 'locked -in' is that it is a new technology. And yes WAV is faster, also larger, and therefore not available to people who cannot afford to change all of their hardware to be able to sustain it. I live in an area where wireless internet connection is only just becoming universally available. Cable connection is not ...satellite may or may not be available depending on exactly where you live, and even with the increased wireless availability there are still 'dead air' areas. So WAV is great if you are in town but not out in the sticks. As to your question on WAV not being recognized as an audio file, Do you want to hazard a guess at how many people don't know that jpg is a picture format? The point I'm making is that if people wanted an audio file and it was a wav file they would use it. They only need to know they want that file, not what format it is. Locked -in, in the way the professor was talking about it I think refers more to such things as lights having switches instead of just coming on when the room reaches a certain stage of darkness and there is someone in it. ( I thought of this example because I was sitting here typing when I couldn't see the keyboard anymore and had to stop to turn on the light.)

'Widespread' or 'broad' doesn't have to encompass the whole world.

This is what distinguishes innovation from invention. Furthermore, commercialization is not intrinsic to the definition either (but either widespread dissemination OR commercialization is).

Observation and theory ARE distinct...right? I am trying to wrap my mind around one of the problems raised with Poppers ideas. One of the objections I find puzzling, is that the issue is raised of him assuming observation and theory are distinct. To me it is clear that the two ARE distinct concepts, even though when we actually practice science, the two influence eachother a great deal. To go anywhere in this discussion, should we not first distinguish between prescriptive and descriptive statements? I can imagine someone sketching an idea in which observation and theory are distinct concepts, without that same person denying the fact that in everyday practice, the two influence are linked. Did Popper ever deny that in the way science was conducted, in real life, observation and theory were not distinct? Did he limit himself to describing an ideal situation, or did he proclaim that his ideas reflected 'how science was in fact practiced'?

Hi, Marloes. From the 1.3lecture in week 1 we know that there is some disadvantages in Poppers ideas. One is that his theory is a little idealism. In my opinion, whether the observation and theory are distinct depends on the aspect we see them. Besides, I think what we really need to distinguish is whether science and practice are distinct. Because we know, Popper always emphasize that science is abour the scientific methods rather than the result.

Non-compartmentalised software development is called 'Agile programming' and is often contrasted with the 'Software Development Life Cycle' SDLC which shares many attributes with linear model of development with each stage completed before the next begins, interaction between stages limited to immediate neighbouring stages and an overall leaden level of excitement. Agile development, on the other hand, has tightly bound very short cycles, immediate and extensive interaction between developers and customers and product available at every iteration. Product feedback steers following iterations. I am sure that there can be some form of innovation development. Mick

Thanks Wolfgang I have heard of it and depending on definitions spiral could fit into agile and the converse is also true, definitions are lovely things:) The linear model lends itself to Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and for many all up-reporting is in KPIs. Measures such as number and value of new pinging machines purchased, metres of oil well bored and so, which measure almost every trivial value and never an important result. I am reminded of Einstein's observation that 'Not every thing that can be measured is worth measuring, and not everything that is worth measuring can be measured.' When I am using agile methods I am also able to apply dialectical methods to improve results - ie unity of opposites, relationship of quality and quantity and so on to interpret, explain and drive improvement. Unfortunately there is not much science. Mick

Buggy whips may also be useful in managing backseat drivers. With regard to the '6 week cycle': innovation is not invention. It's plausible to select, study and refine relatively modest innovations in 6 weeks -- how to better tighten a difficult to reach nut in a car frame that is causing consumer complaints about rattles or poor fit (e.g. do it earlier in production, cut an access notch, design a special tool, etc.) or eliminating a form by adding slots to another one, or improving handling/tabulation/response for customer complaints. We all love big innovations, but there's the perhaps apocryphal story of the olive plant worker who suggested the company could save millions by putting one fewer olive in in each narrow jar of Jumbos. As a consumer, I despise the 'grocery store shrink ray' whereby familiar products regularly decrease container size by a fraction of an ounce each year, but if that missing olive reduces the stress on the jar lid, easing and speeding the canning process; if it reduces product loss/returns due to lid failure; if it allows the use of thinner cheaper lids --- well, maybe it's a genuine innovation. There aren't likely things that CAN consistently save the company millions, whether in the boardroom, in shipping or procurement, or in IT, so eliminating that extra olive is about as good an innovation as they could reasonably expect. Alas, there are only so many 'low hanging fruit'. A company must know when to stop trying to extract benefits by this method -- or at least supplement it with longer term innovation.

The government or enterprise can intervene at any individual step required and pool in resources or finance required for it and rectify the problem.

Feedback loops can be implied, but they are a nuance of the process instead of a component of the process. The linear model works optimally when no revisiting of steps has to occur. As pointed out in other posts, using a linear model may limit innovation since it doesn't scale well for large or complex projects. This is why the software industry has been continually abandoning linear models and adopting iterative innovation models. In this manner, revisiting steps is a feature of the process.

Doug, You are correct.In the US, those who fund the research at universities can and do restrict the types of research that are conducted and what can be explored. In many ways, I think it reflects the Roman Catholic Church during the Middle Ages in this respect. Moreover, most of these investments are tied to industry and to potential profits. In some ways, this constrains development, innovation and research itself. It lends itself to the trappings Kuhn discusses. Because many U.S. companies abandoned a great deal of their intrapreneurial research activities and general research, this, too, has greatly impacted knowledge and the flow of knowledge. In many other countries, funding is much more competitive and research is much more comprehensive and interdisciplinary in nature. This obviously delimits the problems induced by knowledge silos.

Perhaps your proposed alternative has even more flaws than the linear model, in which case you may think, 'hey, perhaps the linear model ain't so bad after all'.

To my mind, the linear model of innovation being an effective tool to mobilize and concentrate resources is much more suitable for command or semi-command developing economies (specifically so-called developmental states) as a temporal model to move on to higher stages of development, to emergence of the competitve market, where the whole process of innovation may be directed by private firms, which are willing and able to do so. And on higher stages of development it seems that more interactions between the government and the private sector are necessary to imrove innovation system with supplemetary role of the former. Of course, the linear model has its deficiencies like wasting resources, institutional overcapacity or disregard of market needs, but it's more about the stage of overall development, where one or another model is suitable.

Hello, all: I'm not going to trash the linear model; apparently, many of my class mates have done a really good job of that. (That is a joke, my friends). However, I do have a suggestion. Turn the linear model into a recursive one. The linear process can continue to move on, but as one 'loops' back to see if anything was missed, overlooked, or simply wrong, corrections can be made. I have no firm opinion about the linear model, other than it might be more prevalent in the US than people realize, but strategic thinkers have fine tuned it along the way. Lastly, one of the fastest ways to promotion in my line of work is procurement. One of the fastest ways to a court-martial and jail is procurement. Many defense contractors have to look down the road 5-10 years, and see how long their systems are going to work. Over-runs are costly, for a variety of reasons, some of them fairly well known, and some of them classified. One constant is that the contractor has to produce a working prototype, and a lot rides on that, because they don't test it; the military does. Some tech seemingly works forever; the B-52 bomber has been around 60 years, with upgrades (recursive?). Others, such as the Abrams main battle tank has been around close to 30. Anything that can be weaponized has to be functional, as well. We defeated many militaries, irregulars, terrorists, etc, with tech that came out of the 1970s. So, I still don't have a firm opinion about the linear model, but on my end of the dirty stick, it has to work. Every time. The innovation is there, the tech is there, and the product is there, or it is a failure. Thanks for hearing me out, and for some really thoughtful commentary on the linear model. Harry

In short; the linear model is applicable in a state controlled environment only or in major companies such as oilcompanies.

I agree, like many other colleagues who MAIN ADVANTAGE of the linear model of innovation is VERY PRACTICAL and displays the classic development process of innovation and thus is a basic concept for understanding this process. I think the main DISADVANTAGE linear innovation model that comes at the same time its high simplicity, since in reality the development of innovation consists of many other linear innovation models that can not be described linearly but quadratically or cubically or more. Besides the model NONSPECIFIC characteristics of the area where they carry out the innovation process (part of the concept of innovation).

In my opinion the LMI has the advantage of being a simple and quick  method to follow. The described steps are easily handled by the  specialists on each specific area (basic and applied  research,development, etc). However it can bring a few  disadvantages in terms of progressively technology upgrades. And being a  step by step process, it doesn't allow to improve steps already  completed. In some cases it may work but nowadays the extreme  competition between markets imposes the constant upgrade of science and  technology features in products being innovated.

Simply - the linear model of innovation is a problem, because it is just that - linear. I can't think of any innovation in recent times that has developed linearly. Specifically, there is no possibility for collaboration or synergy. It is not a useful model for the complexity of society today.

Indeed, it is very linear. It cannot see the activities or situations that do not fall in the line like cross-interaction or complex interaction between the actors at different stages and situations.
Neutral
Week 2: Impact of Modern Science and Technology (S&T) in China
In my opinion, the strength or the advantage of the linear model of innovation is its ability to identify the actors or agents in the process and their performance. More so, it is very useful in identifying the progress or development in the technological development and projects. However, just like any other approaches, it has its own weakness. For having a linear approach, it has the tendency to see the situation strictly as a 'linear' activity only. It can fail in having an oversight regarding the situations or interactions that go out of the line, ie, non-linear interaction or complex and dynamic interaction between various agents or actors at various stages.

e = mc2 was that not the special theory of relatively from 1905? BTW: Einstein worked in that miracle year in the Swiss patent office. And his friend told him that time is suspect, so Einstein came to the idea of the fourth dimension, i.e. 3 spatial dimensions and 1 time dimension. Was Einstein not influcenced by the society in which he operated? Hardly to believe. He wanted to excel in physics and wanted to enter the world of science (not staying in the Swiss patent office). So he had surely social motivation. He was also influenced by older fysician and their theories (e.g. Maxwell). My conclusion: value free science is not possible.

If I have an idea for research because of a conversation with a friend, is that considered being influenced by society? In a very broad sense, our very existence is 'influenced by society', so all activities, from eating to excreting, are influenced by society.

Hello, all: I can't say that I necessarily disagree with any of these posts. Most technologies have a military application before a civilian one. During the era of the space shuttle, almost every shuttle flight had at least one military mission to perform, and one of the mission specialists were military. The majority of astronauts were military; indeed, for PR purposes, Neil Armstrong walked on the moon first ahead of Buzz Aldrin simply because he was a civilian, and the decision was made, so it wouldn't have the appearance of being something like a military expedition at the height of the Vietnam War.

Apparently, Popper Was Correct... Hello, all: I just finished two slide sections in the second lecture series. Interestingly, just as China was beginning it's well-documented rise, there was some doubt as to outcomes with R&D. (William, help me out with this, if you wish). Some felt it was too much 'risk' involved, because outcomes couldn't be determined in advance. That is the basis, in my opinion, of a mixed economic system. If it is legitimate, there is always risk; one just learns to minimize it.

The US did indeed create the first indications that atomic power in the tests at Trinity site in New Mexico. It was the Manhattan Project headed by Robert Oppenheimer, considered the best kept secret in recent US history. Over 6,000 people worked on the Manhattan Project. Whether or not there were moral qualms is open to personal opinion and history. We were bombing Japan unopposed by 1945, but their Army was still intact, and we saw what the lengths they were prepared to go to in Saipan, Tarawa, and Iwo Jima. More people died in the incedniary bombing of Japan than died at Hiroshima. The use of two nuclear weapons ended the war. Period. A war that Japan started, by the way, against the advice of most or its senior military staff. They have been an option ever since. As for 'Science, in any country, doesn't have to do environmental damage control first.' That is simply wrong. The US requires environmental impact statements on any large project, including the military. The US Navy was denied the use of land in North Carolina, as well as an area in Puerto Rico for testing. There have been no major nuclear power plant developments in the US because of impact studies, which have a cost if ignored, such as Three Mile Island. Besides, 'damage control' usually comes after a catastrophic event, doe it not? Thanks for hearing me out. Harry

Why was there no direct link between science and technology in the early days? Well, in my speculation, perhaps technology in the early days didn't demand that much from science which was a systemetical knowledge describing and explaining the world. Instead, technology was mostly based on the experience. Moreover, infered from the 'mind-hand' comparison, scientists didn't favour and even discriminate craftsmen's work, while craftsmen didn't have the insight and knowledge to find out the inner rules hidden in what they were doing.

Most developing countries are among the newly rich countries and most if not all of them got into this category not because of innovation but because they embraced the corporate culture. In a corporation, people are trained to do things in a certain way according to certain clearly mapped out processes and these processes are documented by bodies such as ISO, TQM etc. The corporate world does not encourage innovation. In the corporate world, people are trained to do things by rote, to do certain things in acceptable certain ways and very soon, when faced with a situation, people react in a certain way out of habit.

Could it be that the countries you mention are -or are becoming- in short supply of own base materials as well as short on manpower? R&D is not only applied in designing for new inventions.

One of the reasons why innovation within even moderately well off countries fails to take off is funding.

Well, we can answer this question in the perspective of game theory / economics. Relatively rich countries can afford not to innovate knowing that there are other players already doing the research for them in which they can buy the technologies off despite the hefty price tag. Innovating countries innovate because there is profit from it (not just innovating as a solution to its domestic problems). Instead of other rich countries risking their own capital to seek new innovations (by developing an R&D infrastructure that support the generation of knowledge) which may or may not pay off, they would rather stick to what they can do best and trade the technologies for remuneration, whether resources or money. Should the 'other rich countries' find themselves of their natural resources depleted or not viable anymore, they themselves will turn into innovation (in either domestic or world consumption) for their survival.

First of ALL I thought Taiwan was in China, and in the Graphic appear in a separate way. Taiwan spends more than China? .... for the other countries like Japan and at the other extreme Vietnam I think has to do with Science and also with the proffits they are getting with cheap labor and academics doing research over seas and selling their inventions or thesis to other foreigner universities.

Doug both you and Nuria Perez Perez have included some very interesting data points. they are interesting. I wonder though if we aren't focusing too much solely on the role of government as the only implementor of R&D. What about the personal dimension? I mean think culturally, who wants to rock the boat? In many cases potential new technologies only happen when the person or persons feel comfortable that the idea might even get a hearing. Some cultures look only to the people at the top. If your distance is large from those at the top you may feel hesitant to buck the convention. Alternatively if you work in a family owned business, and you are not family you may not get the much of a hearing of your idea. It is all about the distance you have between yourself and your idea and those people in power that might be able to help realize your idea. Even in an innovative driven environment, say a company who was good at taking existing ideas and making them smaller, more efficient and more cost effective, a person with a completely different new out of the box idea may have trouble making themselves heard because their idea is so different

The developed economies continue to grow because according to the definition of technological progress that will allow to produce more with the same amount of capital, so that the economy can continue to accumulate capital and generate more revenue to the country as the technology is being perfected. Respect to all technology investment in the area and factors matters invested in technology and science. This way we can make a qualitative distinction being the development process of less and more developed economies. Economies delayed in their development process will grow through the accumulation of capital and the most developed economies will grow due to the innovation that will enable them to expand their income due to their balance and therefore the approach to innovation despite its cons is yes

Research and development is a double-edged sword for many nations. There is a significant cost associated with the innovation process. Up until the point of commercialization, this innovation cost that may not be directly reclaimed. This is why some countries need to throttle its level of innovation because they simply do not have the resources to support it. Conversely, those that do innovate have an edge on other countries. Being first to market allows my company to be locked in the market with relative ease. In general, the cost of innovation can be linked to the cost of exerting influence or clout. This is why companies like USA or Japan innovate. It gives them more of a voice internationally.

If we examine the geography of R & D, we could identify that it is strongly practiced and highly funded in the developed countries. It is driven by their economic capacity or ability to support R & D facilities and programs. It is their pressing concern because some reasons: 1) they have huge amount of fund and resources that enable them to support R & D pursuit. 2) they already have an established response or effective system of managing other governmental concerns such as poverty alleviation, industrial development and education. 3) they have institutional commitment to innovation and development through scientific research.

To get ahead in the world you need to either steal a country (USA, Australia, Israel) or steal ideas. Stealing countries certainly has a huge cost to its original inhabitants whereas stealing ideas can lead to improving the lot of humanity ie generic drug companies in India. Some steal both ie a USA company 'RiceTec' patented basmati rice, which had been grown in the Punjab for thousands of years and received a licence for every grain of basmati rice imported into the USA. This act of biopiracy was so blatant that it caused an outcry around the world and most of these patents were withdrawn or overturned.

A good example of a linkage is when universities (i.e. professors -- individually or in groups -- doing research in their labs) are closely linked with industry. In other words, private firms works *with* universities to create solutions they (private firms) face, with the help of advanced research that only university professors typically conduct. Such links are called 'university-industry links (UIL)'. The exact content of such university-industry links can, to be sure, be patents, research papers, personnel, and so forth, but more important than the exact mechanism used to link two (or more) actors together in an innovation system is the need for there to be close cooperation. The mechanism (whether it be patents, research papers, or personnel) can vary depending on project, depending on nature of the research, etc.

Thanks Dr Sharif. I now note that there is an upcoming lecture on Linkages in the Innovation System, which I have yet to get to. I note you say there is a need for close cooperation between the actors in the innovation system. I wonder how much the cultural and language differences between different actors stop this happening -- e.g. the fact that academics may write in ways that are not easily accessible to non-academics -- and how innovation policymakers may attempt to address this. Perhaps this addressed in the upcoming lecture, which I look forward to.

The issue about academics and businesspeople being unable to speak on the same wavelength is a very important one and a very real one. In fact, without having viewed the lectures, its a very astute observation on your part (and no I don't address that issue in the lecture -- it is bit too detailed). Innovation policymakers attempt to address this mainly through two means: First, by encouraging academics to 'reach out' more, and more effectively to businesspeople or society at large. Second, and perhaps with more success, innovation policymakers put the onus on 'bridging institutions' such as technology transfer offices (that I've introduced in a comment, above).

Most industries/technology fields have activities that promote and support such linkages. These are typically in the form of publications and international conferences. For example, the IEEE organization hosts multiple conferences all over the world and for publishing new technological improvements in it's publications.
Neutral
Week 3:  Systems of Innovation and Innovation Policy
I think linkages will be very different for different sectors. For example with a space programme, the long timescales and high risk mean the programme would be government led and mainly government funded, though there still would need to be linkages to tap into research done at universities and institutes and to the supply chain.
Neutral

The recent move in the UK, and to some extent Australia, towards impact assessments for university-based research should also help strengthen linkages between university research and other players in the innovation system.

Professor Sharif: I would think that something like a company dedicated to battery research would be supplier/industry linkage to an automotive company like General Motors. They could do research to produce a better battery which would give longer range, GM would adopt. If successful alternative fuel vehicles would get a sales boost. The rather slow selling Chevy Volt comes to mind. Would you agree?
Negative
Week 3:  Systems of Innovation and Innovation Policy
I agree, absolutely. The key is (and I'm beginning to believe this more and more), that just as important as the presence of the actors is the presence of the linkages. Put it this way: even if an economy has weak actors, so long as the links between the actors are strong, there is a possibility of that innovation system out-performing a comparable innovation system which has strong actors, but weak links among them.

Whenever I think of these things, I remember some examples, first from Kodac, which had its decline with the introduction of digital photography. The funny thing in this story is that it did many patents during its long history but continued investing only what could return profit. For example, when they patented the digital camera in the '70s, they continued investing in traditional film because it was what gave profit, and when entering the quiz branch of digital cameras, came too late. The Kodak could not understand the need to keep up with change or transform your product into the market need.

One of the founders of Sony, Akio Morita, when questioned about difference between east and west in the 70s, in relation to how successful Sony was in new product development, used the analogy of in the west people are like big boulders but connected to each other by weak springs. The boulder can generate a lot of disturbance around itself but the vibration isn't transmitted well. In the east people can be likened to smaller stones but connected to each other by tight springs, each one may not vibrate as much, but the total disturbance caused is greater. Maybe Mr Morita was being humble because I'm sure there are 'boulders' in the east as well, but I think traditionally there have been strong ties in Japan between business and government which has supported their innovation economy.

Yes, indeed, you are right -- I imply that creation of new firms, the continuation of new firms (big and small), all of which should ideally be engaged in innovation are the engines for innovation-led growth. Firms are entities that do not emerge by themselves. They are created by specific individual actors -- i.e. entrepreneurs. So nurturing entrepreneurs, supporting entrepreneurs, and in fact even *creating* entrepreneurs (if that is possible) is all important in order to have the right type of firms to move the innovation system forward.

Entrepreneurs play significant role in economic development as well as S & T and R&D. Entrepreneurs fuel economic growth through their economic participation. More so, entrepreneurs also enhance S & T by engaging on R&D. As entrepreneurs, they need to adjust with the reality and challenges of market and so, they need R & D to improve their competency and place in the market. We could see that entrepreneurs support R&D by devoting a portion of their company's fund on scholarships, university fellowships, and laboratory research.
